        Hello, I'm Jeremy, a Youth Worker, Programmer, and Data Enthusiast!
      </h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to my corner of the digital world! With 17 years of youth work
        experience and a passion for data-driven solutions, I'm thrilled to
        share my journey with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my career as a youth worker, I've witnessed the
        transformative power of mentorship and guidance. Working with diverse
        communities, I've learned to adapt my approach, fostering a safe space
        for young minds to flourish. My passion for making a difference drives
        me every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my work with youth, I'm an aspiring programmer currently pursuing
        a degree in Applied Computer Science at The University of Winnipeg. I'm
        eager to channel my technical skills into meaningful projects that
        benefit youth and their families.
      </p>

      <p>
        What sets me apart is my interest in using data to support and enhance
        youth work initiatives. I'm fascinated by data-driven insights and their
        potential to create positive impacts. My studies in sociology complement
        this passion, equipping me with valuable data gathering and research
        skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not programming or engaged in youth work, you'll likely find me
        exploring the world through my drone's lens or enjoying some gaming as a
        creative escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for joining me on this journey of innovation and impact.
        Together, let's build a brighter future!
