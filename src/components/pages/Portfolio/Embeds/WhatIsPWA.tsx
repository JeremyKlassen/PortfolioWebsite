        TLDR - A PWA (Progressive Web Application) is like a powerful website
        you are able to save and install like a desktop application, or a a
        mobile app on your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        PWAs use strengths of web technologies while also making use of mobile
        features. PWAs can send push notifications, use phone cameras, and work
        offline. You can make it available on certain app stores like Google's
        Play Store, and the Microsoft Store, and they can even recieve automatic
        updates

        example you will see an icon pop up in your address bar. On Iphones and
        Ipads you need to press Safari's 'Share' button and scroll down to 'Add
        to Home Screen.' If it is available in an app store, simply follow the
        usual procedures you would do to find and install a normal app.
